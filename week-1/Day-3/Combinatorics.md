## What is Enumerative Combinatorics?

Enumerative combinatorics simply means systematic counting problems but being systematic is not easy as we think of it. The interesting thing about counting is that you learn something about the thing that you are counting.


## Three Fundamental principles
The fact about combinatorics is that these three principles found the entire combinatorics <br> 
-	Addition
-	Multiplication
-	Inclusion-exclusion <br>
Some assume that permutation & combination as symbols for combinatorics but there are techniques based on the multiplication principle


## Multiplication principle


Suppose that we perform r experiments such that the kth experiment has nk possible outcomes, for k=1,2, ⋯⋯, r. Then there is a total of n1×n2×n3×⋯×nr possible outcomes for the sequence of the r experiment

## Example
Let’s assume Mehran wants to purchase a tablet computer. He can choose either a large or a small screen; a 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB storage capacity, and a black or white cover. How many different options does He have?
Here are the options:
1.	L-64-B
2.	L-64-W
3.	L-128-B
4.	L-128-W
5.	L-256-B
6.	L-256-W
7.	S-64-B
8.	S-64-W
9.	S-128-B
10.	S-128-W
11.	S-256-B
12.	S-256-W

Thus, there are 12 possible options. The multiplication principle states that we can simply multiply the number of options in each category (screen size, memory, color) to get the total number of possibilities, i.e., the answer is 2×3×2=12
