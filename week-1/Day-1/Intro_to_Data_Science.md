## Power of Data…
Billion to trillion tons of data generated around the world from single like, click, email, tweet, credit card swipe that is new piece of data. <br>
- It can used to autonomous vehicle in making decision what to do next from its sensor, cameras <br>
- It can describe the current state of an organization or process e.g., energy consumption can be accomplished by dashboard or alerts <br>
- It can help detect anomalous events such as fraudulent purchases with help previous data we automatically detect new event <br>
- It can diagnose the causes of events and behaviors e.g., our activity on social media platforms <br>
- Data can also predict future events flights get delayed due to weather conditions <br>

## Broder categories where data science is utilized 
-	Decision Making
Whether to decide between two things to buy new shoes or not.
-	Predictive Analysis
Can we predict the demand for any product or can delay of airline
-	Pattern Discovery
Any pattern in which pattern buying grocery or is it seasonal

## What is Data Science? 
Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, machine learning algorithms with specific expertise to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information and make business decision.


## Data Science Project Cycle 
I.	Data Collection & Storage
II.	Data Preparation
III.Exploration & Visualization
IV.	Experimentation & Prediction 


## Data Science Vs Business Intelligence
 
### Data Sciene <br>
- Typically focused on Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics: what will happen in the future, how can prepare for it? <br>
- Often deals with unknowns: Which employees are likely to churn? Which product will a customer purchase next? <br>
- Emphasis on statistics & programming tools designed for flexibility and agility (R, Python, open source libraires, etc.) <br>
- Can be used to deal with high velocity, structured Or unstructured data (text, audio, images, iot signals, etc.) <br>
- Goal: test hypothesis through experimentation & iteration <br>
- Deliverables tend to be algorithms & statistical models <br>
 
### Business Intelligence <br>
- Typically focused on Descriptive Analytics: What happened, why did it happen, how can we learn from it? <br>
- Often deals with specific, known questions: Why are sales declining? Which product drive the highest ROI? <br>
- Emphasis on self-service database, analytics & visualization tools (Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, etc.) <br>
- Designed to deal with static, structured data sources (tabular datasets & pre-planned relational models) <br>
- Goal: identify patterns & trends to turn data into insight <br>
- •	Deliverables tend to be visuals, reports & dashboards <br>

## Different Roles in domain of Data Science 
There are many roles in domain of Data science but generally there four roles as below: <br>

### Data Engineer
Data engineers control the flow of data: they build custom data pipelines and storage systems. They design infrastructure so that data is not only collected, but easy to obtain and process. Within the data science workflow, they focus on the first stage: data collection and storage.

*Tools they use for data engineering are*  <br>
**SQL** <br>
&nbsp; to store and organize data <br>
**Java, Scala, or python** <br>
&nbsp; Programming languages to process data <br>
**Shell** <br>
&nbsp; Command line to automate and run task <br>
**Cloud computing** <br>
&nbsp; AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform <br>
-	Information architects
-	Build data pipelines and storage solutions
-	Maintain data access

###	Data Analyst
 Data analysts describe the present via data. They do this by exploring the data and creating visualizations and dashboards. To do these tasks, they often have to clean data first. Analysts have less programming and stats experience than the other roles. Within the workflow, they focus on the middle two stages: data preparation and exploration and visualization.

*Tools they use for data analysis are* <br> 
**SQL**  <br />
&nbsp; Retrieve and aggregate data <br>
**May have python or R** <br />
&nbsp; Clean and analyze data <br>
**Spreadsheets (Excel or Google Sheets)** <br />
&nbsp; Simple analysis <br>
**BI Tools (Tableau, Power BI, looker)** <br />
&nbsp; Dashboards and Visualizations

-	Perform simpler analyses of that describe data
-	Create reports and dashboard to summarize data
-	Clean data for analysis

###	Data Scientist
Data Scientists have a strong background in statistics, enabling them to find new insights from data, rather than solely describing data. They also use traditional machine learning for prediction and forecasting. Within the workflow, they focus on the last three stages: data preparation and exploration and visualization, and experimentation and prediction.

*Tools they use for data analysis are* <br> 
**SQL** <br>
&nbsp; Retrieve and aggregate data <br>
**Python and/ or R** <br>
 &nbsp; Data science libraries e.g., panadas(python)and (R) 
 tidyverse <br>
-	Versed in Statistical methods
-	Run experiments and analyses for insights 
-	Traditional machine learning


### Machine learning Engineer
Machine learning scientists are like data scientists, but with a machine learning specialization. Machine learning is perhaps the buzziest part of Data Science; it's used to extrapolate what's likely to be true from what we already know. These scientists use training data to classify larger, unrulier data, whether it’s to classify images that contain a car, or create a chatbot. They go beyond traditional machine learning with deep learning. Within the workflow, they do the last three stages with a strong focus on prediction. 

*Tools they use for data analysis are* <br> 
**Python and/ or R** <br>
 &nbsp; Machine Learning libraries e.g., TensorFlow or Spark
-	Predictions and extrapolations
-	Classification 
-	Deep Learning
    - Image processing
    - Natural language processing
